Victor and I have spent much of the past month recovering from Canadian Nationals, but our fledgling audience might be wondering if we will be producing any more content in the future? We have a number of live events coming up over the next few months:

-   October 23, 2016 - [Warhammer 40,000: Conquest - Monthly GNK @ 401 Games](http://vttv.live/event/warhammer-40000-conquest-monthly-gnk-401-games/) (no commentary)
-   November 12, 2016 - [Star Wars: Imperial Assault - Regional Championship @ 401 Games](http://vttv.live/event/star-wars-imperial-assault-2016-regional-championship-401-games/) (top cut commentary)
-   November 19, 2016 - [Star Wars: Armada - Regional Championship @ 401 Games](http://vttv.live/event/star-wars-armada-regionals-401-games/) (final match commentary)
-   November 20, 2016 - Star Wars: Destiny - Launch Day @ 401 Games (casual play, no commentary)
-   January 21, 2016 - [X-Wing - Regional Championship by Face to Face Games @ Seneca College](http://vttv.live/event/x-wing-regionals-face-face-games/) (full commentary)

We are also trying to confirm dates for the 2017 Android Netrunner Store Championship events in Toronto and will be streaming at least one of those tournaments as well. We have some improvements in the works for our livestreaming set up, so you can expect to see some improvements over what we had Canadian Nationals. In addition to these live events, we have some other ideas for unique content for the channel.  But we don't want to make any promises that we can't keep, so we'll keep those plans under our hats for now.  I'm very excited about it. If there is any particular content you'd like to see more of, let us know in the comments.
