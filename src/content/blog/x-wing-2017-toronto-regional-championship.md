Back in January, [Face to Face Games Toronto](http://www.facetofacegames.com/) hosted the 2017 Toronto X-Wing Regional Championship.  Over 100 of the best X-Wing players came to Seneca College and Victor and I had the pleasure of streaming the entire event.  Special thanks to Mike for sacrificing his spot at the event to provide insightful commentary throughout the day. It was a mad dash to get the venue set up, so unfortunately we weren't able to capture the first round.

## Swiss Round 2

It is a bit of a mirror match with Vijay piloting his RAC +Fel against Ben's RAC + Ryad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQtGsZHGwWA

## Swiss Round 3

Will the Attani Mindlink synergy of Tim's Fenn Rau/Guri/Manaroo list be able to overcome Gus' Chopper-anchored list. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ2k12Z6hPA

## Swiss Round 4

It's all about the TIEs in Round 4. Rob flies his Ryad, Backdraft and Tomax Bren into Devon's swarm, including a couple TIE Strikers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwEiE\_G8-yU

Things start to get serious in the Top 16 as Don shows the power of bombs with his triple K-Wing build while Joe makes a repeat appearance with his Miranda/2x Gold Squadron list. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwigzz-T8x8

## Quarterfinal

Lucas tries to show that Rebels can bring swarm two with a trio of Bandit Squadron Pilots alongside a Wild Space Fringer and Gold Squadron Pilot while Alan's TIEs, including Carnor Jax, The Inquisitor and Omega Leader attempt to enforce Imperial dominance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kditxqj3s2w
