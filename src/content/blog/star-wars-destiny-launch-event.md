Once again we were able to get our YouTube videos online in a timely fashion, but we were late with the post on our website.  To help celebrate the launch of Star Wars: Destiny on December 1st, we posted a number of videos we recorded during the Preview Event that took place on November 19th at [401 Games](http://401games.com), including a head-to-head pack opening, a teaching match between Travis and Victor, as well as two casual matches.

## Head-to-Head Pack Opening

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXJHVcXd8uM This was really an experiment in different types of content for the channel, but I got very lucky with my packs.

## Teaching Match

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d\_Nnxvo7mI Victor had played before at Canadian Nationals, but I walk him through the basics of the game - without making too many mistakes.

## Casual Matches

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEl-RkoJ0MQ In the first casual match of the day, I take on Chris in what turns out to be a very close game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwxMQUuzKu4 In the second match, Jon plays Lanny. We tried a few new things with the videos from this event.  Please let us know if you'd like to see anything similar in the future - or if you'd just like to see more Star Wars: Destiny.
