The first local Star Wars: Destiny tournament took play on December 10, 2016 at [Face to Face Games Toronto](http://www.facetofacegames.com/) and VTTV Live was there to cover it. The entry cost was $10 and folks that had pre-ordered a box in November were given free entry.  We had 17 entrants and played five rounds of swiss with 45-minute best-of-one rounds.   This was the first competitive event for these players and some of the first Destiny matches period, so please forgive the gameplay mistakes that were made.

## Round 1

## Round 2

## Round 3

## Round 4

## Round 5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b5lvkQkOFg In the last match of the day, VTTV's own Victor brings a slightly different ePadme/2x Trooper mill desk to match up against Jake's eKylo/2x Nightsister aggro deck.  VTTV pride is on the line!   Congratulations to John Gobeil for winning the first Star Wars: Destiny tournament in Toronto.  I'm sure it won't be the last. Face to Games Toronto will be hosting their next Box Tournament on January 28th.  Entry will be $10 and full details can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/events/1812586529018435/.
