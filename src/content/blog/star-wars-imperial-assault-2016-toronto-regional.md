This year, VTTV was lucky enough to provide live coverage from the 2016 Star Wars: Imperial Assault Toronto Regional Championship from [401 Games](http://401games.com) on November 12th.  While we got the matches up on YouTube relatively quickly, I never got around to collecting them here.

## Quarter-finals

## Semi-finals

## In Closing

I'd like to thank all the players who came out, particularly those that made the trip from out of town.  It was a pretty good tournament and Chris did a great job TOing.  Special thanks to David, Vijay, Chris, Brent and Nav who helped out with commentary.
