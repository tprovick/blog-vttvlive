Welcome to VTTV Live.  Our names are Victor and Travis.  We play a lot of games, some of them competitively.  Many of those games are published by [Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com).  Between the two of us we have won regional and national championships and placed at both the North American and World Championships.  But more importantly, we have committed a lot of our time over the past few years towards helping to build the community around those games in the Greater Toronto Area. For the last 18-24 months, a lot of that effort has gone in to providing video coverage of local competitive events, whether that has been from monthly Game Night Kit tournaments, fully commentated Regional championships or full video productions from last year's Canadian Nationals.  Our focus has been mostly on X-Wing™, Android: Netrunner and Warhammer 40,000: Conquest.  We'd love to stream more Star Wars™: Armada, but haven't found a great setup for filming the large playfield. To date, that coverage has existed in various places, like the [401 Games Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/401games) or [The Tactical Squad's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSVwpQXaQZbVbTD2jjBXi6g) and we have had modest success in building an audience.  Recently, Victor suggested that we try to step our game with that coverage and started purchasing some new equipment to increase the quality of our videos and to allow us to broadcast in more locations.  I recommended that we create a home for those videos to live so that we could build our audience in one place.  And thus, VTTV Live was born. Starting with the 2016 Canadian Nationals on September 9-11th - hosted at the Holiday Inn Yorkdale in Toronto, Canada,  [tickets still available](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/fantasy-flight-games-2016-canadian-nationals-tickets-26452671653) - we will be streaming our content live on both our [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/vttvlive) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3Ylq2jwldNGynR7HLoFbAhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3Ylq2jwldNGynR7HLoFbA) channels.  In the past our viewers have been split on their preference of streaming platform, so we haven't committed one way or another yet.  We plan on producing VOD content as well, so that will certainly live on our Youtube channel.  An upcoming post will provide the full details about our streaming schedule for Canadian Nationals.   Twitch: [https://www.twitch.tv/vttvlive](https://www.twitch.tv/vttvlive) Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3Ylq2jwldNGynR7HLoFbA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3Ylq2jwldNGynR7HLoFbA) Twitter: [https://www.twitter.com/vttvlive](https://www.twitter.com/vttvlive)
